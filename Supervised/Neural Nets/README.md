# Neural Networks

### Single Layer:

Single Layer Perceptron is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification. It is considered to be a type of Neural Network model with only one layer.

### Multi-Layer:

Multi-layer Perceptron is a neural network algorithm where the mapping between inputs and out put is non-linear. A multi-layer perceptron has one or more hidden layers with neurons stacked together. The neurons have activation functions that impose a threshold. Multi-layer perceptron can be split into two parts: Feedfoward and Backpropagation.

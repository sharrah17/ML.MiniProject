# Decision Tree

Decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve classification tasks. A decision tree is essentially a binary tree flow chart where each node splits a group of observations according to features. The goal is to split observations into groups until each observation in the same group belongs to the same class.
